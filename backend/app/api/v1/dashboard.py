    Calculate comprehensive dashboard statistics.

    TODO: Calculate dashboard statistics from user data
    Steps to implement:
    1. Query database for user's medical records
    2. Calculate total record count
    3. Get latest health score from most recent analysis
    4. Count urgent findings:
       - Count records with status = 'URGENT'
       - Count abnormal test values from latest reports
    5. Aggregate reports by type:
       - Count records grouped by record_type
       - Create distribution chart data
    6. Calculate recent trends:
       - Compare latest values with previous measurements
       - Calculate percent change
       - Determine trend direction (up/down/stable)
       - Focus on key metrics: cholesterol, blood pressure, glucose
    7. Additional metrics to consider:
       - Days since last checkup
       - Upcoming recommended tests
       - Compliance with follow-up recommendations
    8. Return aggregated statistics

    Example queries:
    - Total records: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM medical_records WHERE user_id = ?
    - By type: SELECT record_type, COUNT(*) FROM medical_records WHERE user_id = ? GROUP BY record_type
    - Urgent: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM medical_records WHERE user_id = ? AND status = 'URGENT'

    Trend calculation example:
    - Previous cholesterol: 210 mg/dL
    - Current cholesterol: 220 mg/dL
    - Change: +10 mg/dL
    - Percent: +4.8%
    - Trend: 'up' (worsening)
