    Context-aware Q&A using medical history and Gemini AI.

    TODO: Implement context-aware chat with Gemini
    Steps to implement:
    1. Load user's medical history from database:
       - Get all medical records for user
       - Extract key health metrics and findings
       - Identify recent test results
    2. Load conversation context if session_id provided:
       - Get previous messages from this session
       - Maintain conversation continuity
    3. Build rich context prompt for Gemini:
       - Include relevant medical history
       - Include previous conversation
       - Include user's current question
    4. Call Gemini API with context-aware prompt
    5. Parse AI response
    6. Identify which medical records were referenced:
       - Track mentions of specific tests or dates
       - Link back to record IDs
    7. Calculate confidence score:
       - Based on availability of relevant data
       - Based on specificity of question
    8. Generate follow-up suggestions:
       - Related questions user might ask
       - Based on their medical history
    9. Save conversation to database:
       - Create or update session
       - Store both question and answer
    10. Return formatted response with metadata

    Example Gemini prompt structure:
    "You are a medical AI assistant with access to user's health records.

    User's Recent Medical History:
    - Blood Test (Oct 25, 2024): Hemoglobin 12.5, Cholesterol 220
    - X-Ray (Oct 20, 2024): Normal chest X-ray

    Previous Conversation:
    User: What is my hemoglobin level?
    Assistant: Your latest hemoglobin level is 12.5 g/dL...

    Current Question: {user_question}

    Provide a helpful, accurate answer based on their medical records.
    Be specific and reference actual values when possible."
