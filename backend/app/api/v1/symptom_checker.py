    Analyze symptoms using AI and provide assessment.

    TODO: Implement Gemini AI integration here
    Steps to implement:
    1. Format prompt with symptom data including:
       - Symptoms description
       - Patient age and gender
       - Duration of symptoms
       - Severity level (1-10)
    2. Call Gemini API with structured prompt
    3. Parse response into structured format
    4. Calculate urgency score based on symptoms
    5. Extract possible conditions with probabilities
    6. Generate recommended tests
    7. Provide action items and warning signs
    8. Store assessment in database for future reference
    9. Return formatted assessment

    Example Gemini prompt structure:
    "You are a medical AI assistant. Analyze the following symptoms:
    Symptoms: {symptoms}
    Age: {age}, Gender: {gender}
    Duration: {duration}
    Severity: {severity}/10

    Provide:
    1. Urgency level (NORMAL/MODERATE/URGENT)
    2. Possible conditions with probabilities
    3. Recommended tests
    4. Warning signs to watch for
    5. When to seek immediate care"
